# SOLIDDesign
C# code samples for SOLID Design principles

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states:

"A class should have only one reason to change."

In simpler terms, a class should only have one job or responsibility. If a class has more than one reason to change, it has more than one responsibility and should be refactored.


Why is SRP Important?
SRP is important because it leads to:
	Better Maintainability: Classes with a single responsibility are easier to understand and modify.
	Increased Reusability: Classes can be reused in different contexts without dragging along unrelated functionality.
	Improved Testability: Smaller, focused classes are easier to test independently.
	Enhanced Readability: Code is clearer and more understandable when each class has a single purpose.
	Reduced Complexity: Simplifies the design by breaking down complex systems into manageable parts.
	Parallel work: Teams can modify different responsibilities without stepping on each other.
	Lower risk: A change in one responsibility is less likely to break something unrelated.

Violating SRP leads to
	Mixed concerns: Business rules, formatting, I/O, and orchestration sit in the same class.
	Unclear responsibilities: It becomes difficult to understand what the class is supposed to do.
	Unpredictable changes: Changing one part of the class may inadvertently affect other parts.
	Tightly coupled code: Changing one responsibility may affect others.
	Harder maintenance: Understanding or modifying the code becomes difficult.
	Low reusability: You can’t reuse the class without dragging along unrelated responsibilities.

How to Apply SRP
	Identify Responsibilities: Break down the class into distinct responsibilities.
	Create Separate Classes: Each responsibility should be encapsulated in its own class.
	Use Interfaces: Define interfaces for each responsibility to promote loose coupling.
	Refactor Regularly: Regularly review and refactor your code to ensure SRP is maintained.
	Test Independently: Ensure that each class can be tested independently of others.
	Document Responsibilities: Clearly document what each class is responsible for to avoid confusion.
	Keep Classes Small: Aim for small, focused classes that do one thing well.
	Avoid God Classes: Don’t let a single class grow too large or take on too many responsibilities.
